> What is value of Bitcoin?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
> Bitcoin was intended to be digital money for an ideal perfect market for libertarian capitalists, instead Bitcoin has turned out to primarily benefit bankers and speculators at the expense of the environment and the real economy.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">> Purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.

Bitcoin Whitepaper, "Satoshi Nakamoto"</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">- Bitcoin was created to be *a new kind of money* rooted in a vision of a market not bound by geography, banks and governments.

- Despite the intentions of its creators, *Bitcoin is not money*.

- It was designed with a *faulty understanding of money*, and as a result has a positive feedback loop that kick-started an asset bubble.

- In order to fix this bug we need to employ the *labour theory of value*.</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">#### The Finance View

Money is a financial instrument.

The value of a financial instrument can come from being redeemable to its issuer, from providing an income stream or from having a collateralized value.

Bitcoin has a "fair value of zero" and is purely speculative, according to this view.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">#### The Austrian View

Money is a commodity, its value is derived from its use value.

An object cannot be used as money unless it already possesses an objective exchange value based on some other use.

Therefore the austrian view agrees with the finance view that Bitcoin has no value and is purely a speculative asset.

This is ironic given that many Bitcoin proponents imagine they subscribe to Austrian economics, and this is a reason why Bitcoin has a fixed maximum supply, based on a missapplication of the idea of the "gold standard."</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">#### The Classical/Marxist view

Money is a commodity, it's value is derived from its prices of production, which themselves gravitate towards socially necessary labour time.

Applying the classical model to modern "fiat" money is not at all straightforward, however it is very applicable to Bitcoin, and doing so also helps to understand why Bitcoin is broken and thus can not function as money.

- Coconuts

high prices -> more work attracted -> more supply -> lower prices -> less work -> less supply -> higher prices -> repeat

*Market forces regulate prices*

#### Positive Feedback Loop

- Bitcoin

high prices -> more work attracted -> fixed supply -> higher prices -> repeat

low prices -> less work attracted -> fixed supply -> lower prices -> repeat

*Market forces exacerbate volatility*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Bitcoin's Irrational Block Reward creates a positive feedback loop that makes its value boom and bust</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">- Bitcoin can have a stable value if the block reward is a function of the difficulty, and therefor more work results in more supply

- Without the spectacular boom and bust, it wont attract as much attention and
interest, as it's just a digital payment system and not a get rich quick
scheme

#### Other factors
- Speculation, confidence and the Greater Fool
- Portfolio compositions and the Minsky Moment

- in-game money
- Irrational because of the design flaw which dissociates block reward from difficulty / hashing / work

- A Rational Cryptocurrency
- block reward is a fixed ratio to the amount of hashing (work)needed to verify the block

The base value of a Bitcoin is all the work which goes into to maintaining the reliable affordace of Bitcoin as a distributed cryptographically secure transaction service.

Services built on the affordance of Bitcoin, based on the value of the work in Bitcoin, add value according to the supplementary labour in the service, generate profits according to the dominant mode (capitalist worker exploitation).

There is no new value paradigm in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a speculative asset who's price is dissociated from its value and so will always be volatile. Same thing for Ethereum.

Haket can provide the same distributed consensus verified append-only ledger without the speculative volatility of Bitcoin. Because it is rational, it's price will always represent a specific quantum of work.
